This is the initial build process based on my very crusty and horrible makefile.  This should improve as help arrives.

1. Download/build/install cc65
2. Install Java developers kit
3. Check out vm02 source
4. 'cd vm02/src'
5. 'make clean'
6. 'make'
7. 'make image'

This will put the binary files into the vm02/release-$(VERSION) and vm02/samples-$(VERSION) directories in Virtual ][ name format.  You can use something like CiderPress to copy the files into a disk image if you don't use Virtual ][.
